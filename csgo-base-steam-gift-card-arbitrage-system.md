# CSGO/CS2 base steam gift-card arbitrage

​	This draft is to put forward a guess about steam gift-card cash out by CSGO/CS2 skin market place . 

## Abstruct

​	Currently , steam gift-cards are a cheap & nice way for steam player to deposits money . We notice that most of the steam gift-cards are more than 10% worth . So , technically speaking , it is possible to arbitrage & cashout the from the steam gift-card . But the problem is , steam will not spport withdraws or  cash out according to this [disscussions](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/360670708779525209/) . Also , due to the limit of STEAM anti-money-laundering . VALE should not allow users to cash out .

​	CSGO/CS2/DOTA skin marketplace provide a router to make cashout of steam wallets . But due to the height trading fee (15%) of official STEAM community marketplace , most of the skin/items of STEAM community market are at least 10% heighter than others 3th part platform (Like BUFF163 or etc) .So it require a AMM system to against the trading fee rate & withdraws fee rate .
