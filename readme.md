# Ideas about steam skin marketplace 

​	This repo is about some ideas & guesses about steam skin/items marketplace . As a very important part of steam ecosystem , CSGO/CS2 skin/item marketcap already reach 400M , Which means so many marketplace about CSGO/CS2 items are full of liquidity . Liqudity means it can run financially like crypto currency . 

​	As what we knows .Most of the skins in CSGO/CS2 behavior like NFT .Every skin have it's status , and can be print with boost , which makes every skin are unique (I got to sad , more unique than ERC721 lol) . But some items like case/container works like tokens , most of them have good liqudity , and they are not unique , allows to be swap like tokens or currency . The liqudity makes CSGO/CS2 got more financal production , like lending / exchange /gamble event insurence . Due to the limit of steam community , it's not very possible to be another crypto currency . But it still can be a newly part of worldwide finance . Bitcoin-ETF just got approved few months ago since i write down this word , so i think CSGO/CS2 STEAM skin/item marketplacece can works better .
