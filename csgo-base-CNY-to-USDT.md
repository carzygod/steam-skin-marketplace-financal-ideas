​	Draft of csgo/cs2 marketplace usage for money transfer . 

## Abstruct

​	This draft is about a guess of using CSGO/CS2 to transfrom CNY to USDT with Binance c2c market fee rate . 

​	CSGO/CS2 with steam market place allows users to trade their items freely , also allows they transfer their items . Which leads to a lots of third part markest like `Buff` / `market.csgo.com`/`IGXE`/`youpin` . Some of the markets are base on CNY , support `Alipay`/`Wechatpay`/`Chinese-bank`  . And some of the markets are base on USD , support for `Wire-bank`/`Paypal`/`USDT-TRON-ETH`/`BTC`. 

​	Technically speaking , it is possible to buy some items from `CNY` market side , and sell in `USD` market side , to transfer CNY to USD/USDT and avoid receive any dirty money . 

​	Currently , CSGO/CS2 skin/item are similar to NFT collections . But for `case` it works more like tokens . Which supports a good liqudity of case marketplace , much more deeper than skin's .

## Challenge & Risk

- **Poor liquidity **
  - Most of liqudity force on `case`/`container` , Which means most of skin are poor liquidity . It will be a terrible risk as a middle assert . 
- **Heighly price change **
  - Some of skin/item have terrible price change . Leads to the swap rate got affect .It's a bad trip for those who want a stable rate . 
  - More financial should help . Like options , which can stabilize the price of skin/items 
- **7-Day-frozen**
  - Every skin/item that trade will be frozen for 7 days according to the community rules of STEAM . It incress the risk of holding . 
- **Anti-Money-Laundering**
